# 🧩 Neuro-Navigator: Energy-Adaptive Focus Ally

## 🚀 Overview
Neuro-Navigator is a comprehensive multimodal application designed to empower neurodiverse individuals (ADHD/Dyslexia). It transforms overwhelming daily routines into simple, manageable steps by aligning tasks with the user's unique biological rhythms.

## ✨ Core Innovations
* **Energy-Adaptive Scheduler:** Utilizes NLP to detect sentiment and fatigue cues in the user's voice, automatically "downshifting" task complexity to prevent burnout.
* **The "Salami Slicer":** Uses Llama-4-Scout to decompose complex visual scenes (e.g., a messy room) or large documents into <10-minute micro-tasks.
* **Gamified Reward Structure:** Integrates a real-time XP system to provide the immediate dopamine feedback necessary for sustained motivation.
* **Low-Arousal AI Companion:** A multimodal voice interface (Groq + ElevenLabs) providing "Virtual Body Doubling" to reduce executive dysfunction.
